# 🪻 sway

**minimal · wayland · catppuccin lavender**

my personal sway setup — full install script + dotfiles, tuned for a calm,
low-distraction desktop.

## ✨ overview

A single `install.sh` bootstraps a fresh Arch install into this setup: base
system update, shell, window manager, core utilities, GUI apps, networking,
power management, then drops all dotfiles straight into `~/.config`.

```
https://github.com/kusalthemiya/sway/
cd sway
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

Not run as root — the script sudos only where it needs to.

## 📂 structure

```
.
├── fastfetch/
├── fish/
├── foot/
├── fuzzel/
├── mako/
├── nvim/
├── sway/
├── swaylock/
├── waybar/
├── yazi/
├── wallpaper/
├── starship.toml
├── import.json
└── install.sh
```

Every top-level folder here maps 1:1 onto `~/.config/<folder>` — the script
copies each one in, backing up anything that already exists as `*.bak`
before it overwrites it.

## ⚙️ what the script does

1. **update** — full system sync (`pacman -Syu`)
2. **shell** — installs fish + starship, sets fish as default shell
3. **sway stack** — sway, foot, fuzzel, waybar, neovim, yazi, mako, clipboard tools, lock/idle
4. **cli utilities** — bat, btop, fastfetch, imagemagick, thermald, tlp, intel graphics drivers
5. **gui apps** — grim, slurp, mpv, imv, keepassxc, librewolf + uBlock Origin
6. **networking** — syncthing (enabled as a user service) + ufw
7. **power** — enables tlp for battery management
8. **dotfiles** — copies every config folder + `starship.toml` + `wallpaper/` into `~/.config`
9. **cleanup** — removes orphaned packages and package cache

## 🖥️ after install
